# Programming-12---Final-Project


# MAZE PROJECT

#### Description

The program allows a user to construct a maze within a grid, and solve it by hand, limiting the solution to adjacent 'solution squares'

This project was done to demonstrate proficiency over many basic concepts in my Programming 12 Java Course as well as 
- JFrame's GridBagLayout
- Overriding segments of Imported Library methods (JFrame's rendering method for table squares)
- Object construction 
- Method construction
- Inheritance




Initially, the goal of the program was for the user to create a maze, and solve using a variety of different pathing algorithms to test efficiency.
However, this project was cut short due to time limitations and underestimating the difficulty to understand/edit JFrame's rendering system.
If i were to redo this project and not have 4x speed due dates from Covid-19, I would ~~use angular or react.js and not stupid jAVA and JFRAME~~ spend more time on algorithm development, and improve the graphics above the bare minimum.

#### NOTE - Idk why this happens but when VSCode tries to automatically run the program, it calls javac maze.java && java maze instead of javac Maze.java $$ java Maze, just a heads up
